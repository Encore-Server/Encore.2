  Revolutionaries are conversion antagonists sponsored by the [color=#ff0000]Syndicate[/color] who are tasked with taking control of the station. They have no fancy gimmicks or cheap tricks, they only have a cause and strength in numbers.

  ## Objectives
  You must cuff, kill, or exile all of the [textlink="Command staff" link="Command"] on station in no particular order.

  Your objective is [bold]not to destroy the station[/bold], but [italic]to take it over[/italic], so try to minimize damage where possible.

  [bold]The revolution will fail[/bold] if all of the [bold][color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionaries[/color][/bold] die, and all [color=red]Revolutionaries[/color] will de-convert if this happens.

  ## Headrevs & Conversion
  [bold][color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionaries[/color][/bold] are chosen at the start of the shift and begin with a [color=cyan]Revolutionary Manifesto[/color].

  You can convert crew members by using a [color=#a4885c]Revolutionary Manifesto[/color] clicking someone with it.

  Another obstacle in your way are those pesky [color=cyan]mindshield implanters[/color]. These will:
  - Prevent the implanted person from being converted into a [color=red]Revolutionary[/color]
  - De-convert Revolutionaries, and will make them no longer loyal to your cause
  - [bold]Visibly be destroyed upon being implanted into a [color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionary[/color][/bold], giving you away

  Assume all of [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] and [color=#1b67a5]Command[/color] are implanted with mindshields already.

  - Captain
  - Head of Personnel

  Remember, your objective is to take over the station and not to destroy it so try to minimize damage where possible. Viva la revolución!
